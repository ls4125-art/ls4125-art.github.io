    "# **Do High-SAT NYC Public High Schools Receive Higher Instructional Quality Ratings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why I Chose This Question\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City’s public school system is huge and incredibly diverse, with schools varying widely in academic outcomes and school culture. Standardized test results like SAT scores are often used to judge school quality, but do they actually align with how students and families *experience* those schools?\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to explore whether high academic performance is reflected in broader measures of instructional quality. If schools with strong SAT outcomes also earn high instructional ratings, it might suggest consistency between performance metrics and school environment. If not, it could indicate that academic scores alone don’t tell the full story.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses two public datasets from NYC Open Data—one capturing SAT performance and another measuring school survey-based quality ratings—to explore that relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Data I Used\n",
    "\n",
    "I combined two datasets from the NYC Department of Education:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **2012 SAT Results Dataset** — provides school-level SAT performance (Reading, Math, Writing)  \n",
    "- **2019–20 School Quality Guide (High Schools)** — includes survey-based instructional quality ratings (`survey_pp_RI`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key that links these datasets is the **DBN (District–Borough–Number)**, a unique identifier for each school. Since the datasets come from different years, this analysis is not causal—it simply examines whether schools that historically perform well academically also receive high-quality ratings later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "New York City Department of Education. (2021). *2012 SAT Results.* NYC Open Data.  \n",
    "Retrieved from: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2012-SAT-Results/f9bf-2cp4/about_data\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How I Approached the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow for this project looked like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loaded both datasets into pandas.\n",
    "2. Selected relevant fields: SAT scores, school names, enrollment numbers, instructional quality scores.\n",
    "3. Converted SAT score columns to numeric values and computed a combined SAT total.\n",
    "4. Merged the datasets using `dbn` as a common key.\n",
    "5. Cleaned missing values (e.g., filling enrollment gaps with zero).\n",
    "6. Created a scatterplot with an OLS trendline to visualize the relationship.\n",
    "7. Calculated the correlation between SAT performance and instructional quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helped me align academic outcomes with perceived instructional quality across NYC high schools.\n"

    "\n",
    "The analysis finds only a weak positive relationship between SAT performance and instructional quality among NYC public high schools. Although schools with higher total SAT scores tend to have slightly higher “Rigorous Instruction” ratings, the correlation is low (≈ 0.17), and substantial variation exists across schools regardless of test outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that standardized academic performance does not strongly reflect survey-based measures of instructional quality. Instructional effectiveness appears to be influenced by broader factors such as curriculum design, teacher collaboration, school climate, and student support systems—dimensions that are not captured by SAT results alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, SAT scores can indicate academic performance but should not be used as a standalone proxy for evaluating instructional quality or school effectiveness.\n"
